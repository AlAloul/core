[![Core.js](https://github.com/rblalock/core/raw/master/corejs.png)](https://github.com/mcongrove/core)

Core.js is a boilerplate for [Titanium Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy). Use it to quickly start building applications without all the overhead of having to create screen management methods, utility functions and device detection.

Getting Started
===============

The `lib` folder is where the core.js singleton and the helpers are located.  Copy this in to
your Alloy project to start using.

If you want to run the sample apps: Clone this repository into your Titanium Studio Workspace:

```
	cd ~/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace
	git clone git@github.com:rblalock/core.git
```

Now you can open Titanium Studio and import the project, which is in the `examples` folder:

```
	File > Importâ€¦ > Existing Mobile Project > Select the examples folder (it's where the app is)
```

At this point you should have the project imported, open, and ready to edit.

Generated Documentation
===================

1. Install JSDuck for doc generation
2. Run this command from your project root dir: `jsduck ./lib --config ./documentation/jsduck.json`
3. The documentation html will be in `documentation/generatedDocumentation`

High-Level Overview
===================

##### core.js

The `/app/lib/core.js` file is home to the bulk of the boilerplate (hence the name). It provides access to commonly used methods including:

 * Device information
 * Network connection information
 * Global event handlers (resume, exit, orientation change, etc.)
 * Screen management via the Navigator object (which should be a module specific to your navigation
 strategy).

Any methods you create that are used throughout the application and relate to any of these functions should probably also be included in the `core.js` file.

##### http.js

The included `/app/lib/http.js` library is used to make HTTP requests and includes support for the most-used functionality. The HTTP library also adds some bonuses, such as data pass-through, which lets you send identifying information along with the HTTP request and receive it in the data return callback, helping associate data return with data requests.

##### utilities.js

A growing list of utility helper methods are available in the `/app/lib/utilities.js` file. These include:

 * File existance
 * Number formatting
 * HEX to HSB color conversion
 * String cleaning, escaping, decoding and translating

Ti.mocha Tests
===================
You can toggle the ti.mocha tests in `examples/app/config.json` -> mochaTesting
