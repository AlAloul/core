[![Core.js](https://github.com/mcongrove/core/raw/master/corejs.png)](https://github.com/mcongrove/core)

Core.js is a boilerplate for [Titanium Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy). Use it to quickly start building applications without all the overhead of having to create screen management methods, utility functions and device detection.

Getting Started
---------------

To start your application using Core.js simply clone this repository into your Titanium Studio Workspace:

	cd ~/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace
	git clone git@github.com:mcongrove/core.git

Now you can open Titanium Studio and import the project:

	File > Importâ€¦ > Existing Mobile Project

At this point you should have the project imported, open, and ready to edit.

High-Level Architecture
-----------------------

###### index.js

All Alloy projects start by opening the `/app/controllers/index.js` file. Instead of using this entry-point as a controller for the home screen, we instead "hijack" it and use it to instantiate our `core.js` file (after which we open our first screen).

###### core.js

The `/app/lib/core.js` file is home to the bulk of the boilerplate (hence the name). It provides access to commonly used methods including:

 * Device information
 * Network connection information
 * Global event handlers (resume, exit, orientation change, etc.)
 * Screen management

Any methods you create that are used throughout the application and relate to any of these functions should probably also be included in the `core.js` file.

###### http.js

The included `/app/lib/http.js` library is used to make HTTP requests and includes support for the most-used functionality. The HTTP library also adds some bonuses, such as data pass-through, which lets you send identifying information along with the HTTP request and receive it in the data return callback, helping associate data return with data requests.

###### utilities.js

A growing list of utility helper methods are available in the `/app/lib/utilities.js` file. These include:

 * File existance
 * Number formatting
 * HEX to HSB color conversion
 * String cleaning, escaping, decoding and translating
